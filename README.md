# Detect faces
This python script detect faces in images using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). To execute simply pass the path that contains the images to analyze. 

```sh
python detect-faces.py ~/images/cars/
```
If any image contains a face, a file called `detected-images.txt` is created with the absolute route of the image.
